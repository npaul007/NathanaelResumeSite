                <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
                <p>I am an aspiring software developer currently working on obtaining an Associates Degree at Norwalk Community College. Before I had chosen to become a Computer Science major, the idea of being a software engineer seemed very boring to me. It was only until my father showed me the amazing things that I could create through the use of software engineering that I fell in love with this career path. My current objective(other than obtaining my Associates Degree) is to continue to hone my skills and become a well rounded software developer. I want to use the skills I have learned to help improve the quality of life of every individual alive, and to make the world a better place.</p>
